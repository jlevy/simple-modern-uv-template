# Development

## Setting Up uv

This project is set up to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python and
dependencies. First, be sure you
[have uv installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Then
[fork the changeme/changeme repo](https://github.com/changeme/changeme/fork)
(having your own fork will make it easier to contribute) and
[clone it](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

## Basic Developer Workflows

The `Makefile` simply offers shortcuts to `uv` commands for developer convenience.
(For clarity, GitHub Actions don’t use the Makefile and just call `uv` directly.)

```shell
# First, install all dependencies and set up your virtual environment.
# This simply runs `uv sync --all-extras` to install all packages,
# including dev dependencies and optional dependencies.
make install

# Run uv sync, lint, and test:
make

# Build wheel:
make build

# Linting:
make lint

# Run tests:
make test

# Delete all the build artifacts:
make clean

# Upgrade dependencies to compatible versions:
make upgrade

# To run tests by hand:
uv run pytest   # all tests
uv run pytest -s src/module/some_file.py  # one test, showing outputs

# Build and install current dev executables, to let you use your dev copies
# as local tools:
uv tool install --editable .

# Dependency management directly with uv:
# Add a new dependency:
uv add package_name
# Add a development dependency:
uv add --dev package_name
# Update to latest compatible versions (including dependencies on git repos):
uv sync --upgrade
# Update a specific package:
uv lock --upgrade-package package_name
# Update dependencies on a package:
uv add package_name@latest

# Run a shell within the Python environment:
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

See [uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for details.

## IDE setup

If you use VSCode or a fork like Cursor or Windsurf, you can install the following
extensions:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

- [Based Pyright](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=detachhead.basedpyright)
  for type checking. Note that this extension works with non-Microsoft VSCode forks like
  Cursor.

## Updating Versions

Periodically update dependency and tool versions to stay current.

**Python dependencies** (in `pyproject.toml` under `[dependency-groups] dev`):

Check latest versions on PyPI for each package and bump the minimum version pins.
Key dev dependencies: `ruff`, `basedpyright`, `pytest`, `pytest-sugar`, `codespell`,
`rich`, `funlog`.

```shell
# After bumping versions in pyproject.toml, sync and verify:
uv sync --upgrade
uv run python devtools/lint.py
uv run pytest
```

**uv version** (in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `publish.yml`):

Check the latest uv version at <https://pypi.org/project/uv/> and update the
`version:` field under the `astral-sh/setup-uv` step in both workflow files.

**GitHub Actions** (in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `publish.yml`):

Check for new major versions of actions used:
- `actions/checkout` — <https://github.com/actions/checkout/releases>
- `astral-sh/setup-uv` — <https://github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/releases>

**Python version matrix** (in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

Update the `python-version` matrix when new Python releases are available.
Also update the classifiers in `pyproject.toml` to match.

## Publishing Releases

See [publishing.md](publishing.md) for instructions on publishing to PyPI.
